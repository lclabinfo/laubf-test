He tells the story of a rich man who lived in luxury every day, and Lazarus, a beggar covered in sores who lay at his gate.</p><p>When both died, Lazarus was carried to Abraham's side, while the rich man found himself in torment. The great reversal shows that earthly wealth means nothing in eternity.</p><p>Jesus warns us: "No one can serve two masters.
